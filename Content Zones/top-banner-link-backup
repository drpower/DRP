SHIPPING & REFUNDS

All items are shipped FREE via USPS with insurance and tracking included. Please make sure your address is valid when placing your order, otherwise we might be forced to cancel your order if USPS doesn't accept it. Tracking numbers will be sent through Etsy messages once the purchase is completed. Be sure to check your messages after you place your order.

We do not allow returns or exchanges, but we will address any issues if your item is lost or damaged during shipment. If your product arrives damaged or is not received within a reasonable timeframe, please contact us immediately. 

We strive to provide accurate descriptions of our vintage items, but limited information on certain products may sometimes lead to inaccuracies. If you discover that an item has been misrepresented in any manner, please reach out to us.
