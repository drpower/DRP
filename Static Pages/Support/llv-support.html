    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h3>Q: What are the benefits among the different models?</h3>
    <p>A: The answer depends on your property and personal preferences. If you currently enjoy mowing your lawn with a riding tractor, or if you're planning to get a rider, one of our tow-behind models may be ideal. These leaf collection machines work very fast and cover large areas quickly. Their extra large capacities mean you can work longer without having to empty collected debris. And with a 10:1 reduction they shred material into very fine mulch. Plus, with a DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Leaf and Lawn Vacuum, you can work in ride-on comfort!</p>
    <p>The DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Walk-Behind Leaf and Lawn Vacuum is a great choice if you don't own a riding tractor or if you simply prefer to walk while you work. The self-propelled machines are perfect for leaf collection in highly landscaped areas. They can easily get into places where a rider and tow-behind unit simply wouldn't fit. Steep slopes (up to 20&deg;) - where you wouldn't take a rider - are also better-suited to a Walk-Behind model. <!-- Finally, if your yard is on the smaller side, a walk-behind model or walk-behind blower may be all the machine you need.--></p>
    <h3>Q: Are they easy to start?</h3>
    <p>A: The electric-starting models have a powerful battery that recharges as the engine runs, and they start instantly with the turn of key or flip of a switch. The manual-starting models feature compression release and electronic ignitions, for quick starts with one or two easy pulls.</p>
    <h3>Q: Can I use the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum on hills?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes, the walk-behind and tow-behind models can be used on slopes up to 15&deg;.</p>
    <h3>Q: How are DR<sup>&reg;</sup> products shipped?</h3>
    <p>A: We offer 3 basic options:<br />
      1) Delivery to a Depot<br />
      2) Delivery to Home or Business<br />
      3) Enhanced Home Delivery</p>
    <h3>Q: What happens if my machine needs service?</h3>

        <h2 class="media-heading">Tow-Behind Models</h2>
        <h3>The following information is provided to demonstrate proper techniques when operating your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Leaf and Lawn Vacuum.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This information pertains to the most recent Leaf and Lawn Vacuum models. Please refer to your Safety &amp; Owner's Manual for instructions specific to your machine. Please refer to the Engine Owner's Manual for engine specific instructions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      <p>Pick up stones, metal objects, glass and sticks before vacuuming.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Efficient uses of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum</h2>
    <h3>For the most efficient use of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum, use this sequence of steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather and pile sticks for chipping.</li>
      <li>Chip the smaller sticks and branches.</li>
      <li>Remove the rear panel and load the larger limbs.</li>
      <li>Dump the load at the desired location.</li>
      <li>Mow and vacuum leaves.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Be careful in corners</h2>
    <p>Practice in first gear to understand the effects of the trailer on your ability to turn sharply. Drive your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum into the corner of your property and back out straight to mow as close to the corner as possible. Be sure to say away from fences when you want to turn, as the back will swing wide during a turn. Avoid going through ditches.</p>
    <h2>Vacuum with the discharge side toward the leaves</h2>
    <p>The lawn deck will tend to scatter some leaves in front and to the right of the lawn deck. Keeping the discharge side toward the remaining leaves will simplify cleanup by avoiding blowing leaves back onto the areas that you already finished. When you need to vacuum with the discharge side toward the completed area of the lawn, then overlap the discharge side of the lawn deck at least a foot over the already completed section of the lawn.</p>
    <h2>Keep grass length and cutting height low for optimal performance</h2>
    <p>To prevent clogging the lawn deck adapter and vacuum hose, mow grass that is dry and not more 2&quot; at a time. To keep your grass healthy, we recommend cutting less than 1/3 the grass height.</p>
    <h2>Maximize lift from your lawn deck</h2>
    <p>Run your lawn deck with your Tractor at full throttle all the time to maximize the lift from your lawn deck and assist your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum system.</p>
    <h2>Watch for curbs, stonewalls, and debris</h2>
    <p>Avoid dragging the inlet hose over curbs, stonewalls, or piles of cut branches. The hose is tough, but can puncture on sharp objects. This could also crack the mower deck adapter.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      <p>Gasoline is a highly flammable liquid. Gasoline also gives off flammable vapor that can be easily ignited and cause a fire or explosion. Never overlook the hazards of gasoline. Always follow these precautions:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Never run the engine in an enclosed area or without proper ventilation as the exhaust from the engine contains carbon monoxide, which is an odorless, tasteless, and deadly poisonous gas.</li>
      <li>Store all fuel and oil in containers specifically designed and approved for this purpose and keep away from heat and open flame, and out of the reach of children.</li>
      <li>Fill the gasoline tank outdoors with the engine off and allow the engine to cool completely. Do not handle gasoline if you or anyone nearby is smoking, or if you're near anything that could cause it to ignite or explode. Replace the fuel tank and fuel container caps securely.</li>
      <li>If you spill gasoline, do not attempt to start the engine. Move the machine away from the area of the spill and avoid creating any source of ignition until the gas vapors have dissipated. Wipe up any spilled fuel to prevent a fire hazard and properly dispose of the waste.</li>
      <li>Allow the engine to cool completely and empty the collector box before storing the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum in any enclosure. Remember, decomposing material can generate heat and start a fire. Never store the machine with gas in the tank or a fuel container, near an open flame or spark such as a water heater, space heater, clothes dryer or furnace.</li>
      <li>Never make adjustments or repairs with the engine running. Disconnect the spark plug wire and keep the wire away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting.</li>
      <li>Never check for an ignition spark with the spark plug or spark plug wire removed. Always use an approved spark plug tester.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with safety devices. Regularly check their proper operation.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with the engine's governor setting or modify the engine speed. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed and protects the engine. Over-speeding the engine is dangerous and will cause damage to the engine and to the other moving parts of the machine. If required, see your authorized engine dealer for engine governor adjustments.</li>
      <li>To reduce fire hazard, keep the engine and muffler area free of debris build-up such as leaves, grass, oil, grease, or any other combustible material. Clean the engine area after each use.</li>
      <li>Do not operate the engine with the air cleaner or the cover over the carburetor air-intake removed, except for adjustment. Removal of such parts could create a fire hazard.</li>
      <li>Never operate the engine without the muffler. Inspect the muffler periodically and replace if necessary. If equipped with a muffler deflector, inspect the deflector periodically and replace if necessary.</li>
      <li>Always check fuel lines and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks, replace if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Change the oil.</li>
        <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Walk-Behind Leaf and Lawn Vacuum will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/shop-by-category/maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate.</li>
        <li>Remove the spark plug and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull the recoil starter rope until you feel strong resistance. This will coat the piston and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
        <li>Clean or replace the air filter.</li>
        <li>Clean dirt and debris from the cylinder head cooling fins, impeller housing, debris screen, and muffler area of the engine.</li>
        <li>Clean the debris bag. For step-by-step instructions on removing and emptying the debris bag, see your Owner's Manual.</li>
        <li>For electric-start models, store the battery in a dry area that will not freeze. If you will not use the machine over a long period, charge the battery every four to six weeks. See your Owner's Manual for more information on battery care.</li>

        <li>For minimal storage space, or if you store outside, you can disassemble the collector box by removing the rear &amp; front panels, centrifugal separator (top), and the side panels. The collector box pieces then can be stacked against a wall in a convenient location. (See your Owner's Manual disassembly and re-assembly of the collector box.)</li>
