    <ul>
      <li>Check that the tine drive clutch is disengaged.</li>
      <li>Check the engine oil level, adjust as needed. If the level is too low, then Engine may be seized.</li>
      <li>There may be an oil compression lock in the cylinder. Take out the spark plug; hold a rag over the spark plug hole and pull the recoil cord several times to blow out any oil in the cylinder. Wipe off the spark plug and reinstall it.</li>
      <li>Try to turn the engine pulley by hand, with the spark plug wire off. If it turns, the recoil may be broken or jammed.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Check the In-Line Fuses in front of the Battery. See your Owner's Manual.</li>
      <li>Check the wire connections, especially the ground connection. This is the large black wire leading from the Battery, and connected to the engine.</li>
      <li>Check the wire connections to the solenoid. Disconnect the black battery ground wire first to avoid sparks. Make sure that all of the connections are clean and tight. Reconnect the battery ground wire.</li>
      <li>Check the ground connection on the solenoid where it is bolted to the frame. Using a wrench or socket, tighten the bolts to ensure a good connection to the frame.</li>
      <li>The battery may not be charged. Check the voltage yourself or at a service station. If the voltage is low, charge the battery with a 12-volt, 1- to 2-amp trickle charger. If you don't run your machine for at least 45 minutes at a time, the battery may need to be periodically charged. See the Battery Care section in your Owner's Manual.</li>

    <p>A: The DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller can be towed by an ATV, riding mower or utility tractor.</p>
    <h3>Q: How wide and deep does the Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller till?</h3>
    <p>A: The Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller will till a path 3-feet wide and up to 7.5&quot; deep.</p>
    <h3>Q: What does the remote control do?</h3>
    <p>A: The remote control allows you to raise or lower the tines, turn the Spreader Attachment on and off, and raise/lower the Culti-packer Attachment.</p>
    <h3>Q: Can the Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller be used for building food plots?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes. Towed by your ATV or small tractor, the Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller can easily be transported to areas where you'd like to plant a food plot to attract wildlife. The powered tines prepare deep, ready-to-plant seedbeds - in a fraction of the time compared to non-powered, drag-behind disc units. Using non-powered food plot equipment requires dozens of passes just to scratch the surface of the soil. These machine take a huge amount of power to drag them, putting tremendous strain on your towing vehicle.</p>
    <h3>Q: How easy is it to start?</h3>
    <p>A: The electric-starting model with automotive-style turn-key ignition and 12-volt battery are very easy to start. Just turn the key and you're ready to go. (The battery recharges as the engine runs.) The manual-starting model, with compression release and electronic ignition, starts with one or two easy pulls.</p>

    <h2>Tilling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In compacted soil or sod, or in food plot and sod busting applications, several passes may be necessary to till to a depth of seven (7) inches.  For the first pass, just scratch the surface.  The depth for each successive pass needs to be determined by individual site and soil conditions.  If the machine stalls repeatedly, you should till slower or not as deep.</li>
      <li>Check the ground moisture.  Do not till if you can make a ball of soil in your hand from the ground to be tilled; it is too wet.  Create full tillage (depths up to 7&quot;) after entire area is dry.</li>
      <li>To obtain the most efficient tillage, operate the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller engine at full throttle at the slowest speed of your tow vehicle.</li>
      <li>When operating the machine for the first time, proceed slowly and carefully until you become familiar with the proper method of operating the machine.</li>
      <li>Soil conditions will determine how deep the machine can penetrate on the first pass.</li>
      <li>In damp soil, till only the top inch of seedbed.  Allow tillage to dry for several hours in sunny and/or windy conditions.</li>
      <li>Listen to your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Roto-Tiller engine.  When the engine RPM decreases or stalls (overloaded condition) raise the Tines for shallower tilling.  If the engine is lightly loaded, lower the tines to increase the tilling depth.</li>
      <li>If the soil is extremely hard and dry, it may be desirable to &quot;cross till&quot; an area at a shallow depth first, then till the soil in the direction of planting rows on subsequent passes until the desired tillage is obtained.</li>

    <h3>Safety with gasoline-powered machines</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>Gasoline is a highly flammable liquid. Gasoline also gives off flammable vapor that can be easily ignited and cause a fire or explosion. Never overlook the hazards of gasoline. Always follow these precautions:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Never run the engine in an enclosed area or without proper ventilation as the exhaust from the engine contains carbon monoxide, which is an odorless, tasteless, and deadly poisonous gas.</li>
      <li>Store all fuel and oil in containers specifically designed and approved for this purpose and keep away from heat and open flame, and out of the reach of children.</li>
      <li>Always check fuel lines and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks. Replace when worn or damaged and after 5 years of use.</li>
      <li>Fill the gasoline tank outdoors with the engine off and allow the engine to cool completely. Do not handle gasoline if you or anyone nearby is smoking, or if you're near anything that could cause it to ignite or explode. Replace the fuel tank and fuel container caps securely.</li>
      <li>If you spill gasoline, do not attempt to start the engine. Move the machine away from the area of the spill and avoid creating any source of ignition until the gas vapors have dissipated. Wipe up any spilled fuel to prevent a fire hazard and properly dispose of the waste.</li>
      <li>Allow the engine to cool completely before storing the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Roto-Tiller in any enclosure. Never store the machine with gas in the tank or a fuel container, near an open flame or spark such as a water heater, space heater, clothes dryer or furnace.</li>
      <li>Never make adjustments or repairs with the engine running. Shut down the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping it wire away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, then wait 5 minutes before making adjustments or repairs.</li>
      <li>Never check for an ignition spark with the spark plug or spark plug wire removed. Always use an approved spark plug tester.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly/</li>
      <li>To reduce fire hazard, keep the engine cooling fan and muffler area free of debris build-up such as leaves, grass, oil, grease or any other combustible material.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with the engine's governor setting or modify the engine speed. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed and protects the engine. Over-speeding the engine is dangerous and will cause damage to the engine and to the other moving parts of the machine. If required, see your authorized engine dealer for engine governor adjustments.</li>
      <li>Never operate the engine without the muffler. Inspect the muffler periodically and replace if necessary. If equipped with a muffler deflector, inspect the deflector periodically and replace if necessary.</li>
      <li>Never operate the engine with the air cleaner or cover over the carburetor air intake removed, except for adjustment. Removal of such parts could create a fire hazard. Do not use flammable solutions to clean air filter.</li>
      <li>Always check fuel lines and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks, replace if necessary.</li>
      <li>Replace rubber fuel lines and grommets when worn or damaged, but do not use over five (5) years.</li>

    </div>
    <h3>End-of-Season Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the engine oil. This will help to eliminate sludge and acids in the engine. For winter use, use SAE 5W-30W oil.</li>
      <li>Remove the spark plug(s) and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull the recoil starter rope (if equipped) or crank the engine over using the electric start. This will coat the piston and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
      <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Roto-Tiller will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/power-equipment/batteries-parts-and-maintenance/machine-maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate.</li>
      <li>Clean/replace the engine air filter. Reference the Engine Owner's Manual.</li>
      <li>Clean dirt and debris from the engine cylinder head cooling fins, debris screen, and muffler.</li>
      <li>Clean out residual debris from the under the debris shield and tine assemblies.</li>
      <li>Lubricate the tine assemblies. See your Owner's Manual.</li>
      <li>Touch up all rusted or chipped paint surfaces.  Sand them lightly before painting.</li>
      <li>Be sure all nuts, bolts, and screws are securely fastened.</li>
      <li>Inspect moving parts and the tine drive belt for damage and wear; replace if necessary.</li>
      <li>Store the battery in a dry area that will not freeze. If you will not use the machine over a long period, charge the battery every four to six weeks. See your Owner's Manual for Battery Care.</li>
      <li>If possible, store your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Roto-Tiller inside, but not near an open flame or spark such as found in a water heater.</li>
      <li>After the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Roto-Tiller has cooled, cover the machine with a suitable protective cover that does not retain moisture.  Do not use plastic as this material cannot breathe; it also allows condensation to form, which will cause your machine to rust.</li>
