          <p>When performing any maintenance, you must first shut off the tow vehicle, set the parking brake and disconnect power from the battery of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Rototiller by separating the fuse holder.

        <div class="alt-header-support">Recoil will not pull out or is difficult to pull</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Check that the tine drive clutch is disengaged.</li>
          <li>Check the engine oil level, adjust as needed. If the level is too low, then Engine may be seized.</li>
          <li>There may be an oil compression lock in the cylinder. Take out the spark plug; hold a rag over the spark plug hole and pull the recoil cord several times to blow out any oil in the cylinder. Wipe off the spark plug and reinstall it.</li>
          <li>Try to turn the engine pulley by hand, with the spark plug wire off. If it turns, the recoil may be broken or jammed.</li>

          <li>Check the throttle and choke settings, adjustment and travel.</li>

          <li>Make sure the wiring is all connected and the connections are tight.</li>

          <li>Check the wire connections, especially the ground connection. This is the large black wire leading from the Battery, and connected to the engine.</li>
          <li>Check the wire connections to the solenoid. Disconnect the black battery ground wire first to avoid sparks. Make sure that all of the connections are clean and tight. Reconnect the battery ground wire.</li>
          <li>Check the ground connection on the solenoid where it is bolted to the frame. Using a wrench or socket, tighten the bolts to ensure a good connection to the frame.</li>
          <li>The battery may not be charged. Check the voltage yourself or at a service station. If the voltage is low, charge the battery with a 12-volt, 1- to 2-amp trickle charger. If you don't run your machine for at least 45 minutes at a time, the battery may need to be periodically charged. See the Battery Care section in your Owner's Manual.</li>

        <h2>Tilling</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In compacted soil or sod, or in food plot and sod busting applications, several passes may be necessary to till to a depth of seven (7) inches.  For the first pass, just scratch the surface.  The depth for each successive pass needs to be determined by individual site and soil conditions.  If the machine stalls repeatedly, you should till slower or not as deep.</li>
          <li>Check the ground moisture.  Do not till if you can make a ball of soil in your hand from the ground to be tilled; it is too wet.  Create full tillage (depths up to 7&quot;) after entire area is dry.</li>
          <li>To obtain the most efficient tillage, operate the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Rototiller engine at full throttle at the slowest speed of your tow vehicle.</li>
          <li>When operating the machine for the first time, proceed slowly and carefully until you become familiar with the proper method of operating the machine.</li>
          <li>Soil conditions will determine how deep the machine can penetrate on the first pass.</li>
          <li>In damp soil, till only the top inch of seedbed.  Allow tillage to dry for several hours in sunny and/or windy conditions.</li>
          <li>Listen to your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Rototiller engine.  When the engine RPM decreases or stalls (overloaded condition) raise the Tines for shallower tilling.  If the engine is lightly loaded, lower the tines to increase the tilling depth.</li>
          <li>If the soil is extremely hard and dry, it may be desirable to &quot;cross till&quot; an area at a shallow depth first, then till the soil in the direction of planting rows on subsequent passes until the desired tillage is obtained.</li>

                    NOTE:  If you raise the tines at the end of a pass, use care to lower them back to the same depth.  Tilling too deep on the first pass may cause the Tiller to stall or break shear pins.</li>

        <h2>Handling and Transporting (Tow-Behind Models)</h2>
        <p>We recommend using two (2) people to lift the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Tow-Behind Rototiller. Lift the machine by the SMOOTH-TRAK&trade; Hitch to connect and disconnect from your tow vehicle. To transport the machine with your tow vehicle, first raise the tines to the MAX position (lower the wheels) using the control box.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
          <p>Never lift the machine while the engine is running.</p>

        <div class="alt-header-support">End-of-Season Procedure</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Change the engine oil. This will help to eliminate sludge and acids in the engine. For winter use, use SAE 5W-30W oil.</li>
          <li>Remove the spark plug(s) and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull the recoil starter rope (if equipped) or crank the engine over using the electric start. This will coat the piston and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
          <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Rototiller will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/power-equipment/batteries-parts-and-maintenance/machine-maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate.</li>
          <li>Clean/replace the engine air filter. Reference the Engine Owner's Manual.</li>
          <li>Clean dirt and debris from the engine cylinder head cooling fins, debris screen, and muffler.</li>
          <li>Clean out residual debris from the under the debris shield and tine assemblies.</li>
          <li>Lubricate the tine assemblies. See your Owner's Manual.</li>
          <li>Touch up all rusted or chipped paint surfaces.  Sand them lightly before painting.</li>
          <li>Be sure all nuts, bolts, and screws are securely fastened.</li>
          <li>Inspect moving parts and the tine drive belt for damage and wear; replace if necessary.</li>
          <li>Store the battery in a dry area that will not freeze. If you will not use the machine over a long period, charge the battery every four to six weeks. See your Owner's Manual for Battery Care.</li>
          <li>If possible, store your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Rototiller inside, but not near an open flame or spark such as found in a water heater.</li>
          <li>After the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Rototiller has cooled, cover the machine with a suitable protective cover that does not retain moisture.  Do not use plastic as this material cannot breathe; it also allows condensation to form, which will cause your machine to rust.</li>
