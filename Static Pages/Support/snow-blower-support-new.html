        <div class="alt-header-support">Q: What are the speed options?</div>
        <p>A: There are six forward gears ranging from 1.3mph to 2.2mph, and two reverse options, 0.5mph and 1mph.</p>

        <div class="alt-header-support">Q: How does my warranty work?</div>
        <p>A: DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machines come with a 2-year warranty (for residential use, 90 days for commercial use) that covers all defects in materials and workmanship. Extended warranties (1-year, 2-year, and 3-year) are available to extend your coverage for a total of up to 5 years. If, while your machine is under warranty, you experience a problem with your machine, your warranty will cover the replacement and installation of any non-wearable parts deemed to be the result of defective materials or workmanship.</p>

              <div class="alt-header-support">Safety with Gasoline - Powered Machines</div>
              <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Gasoline is a highly flammable liquid.  Gasoline also gives off flammable vapor that can be easily ignited and cause a fire or explosion.  Never overlook the hazards of gasoline.  Always follow these precautions:</p>
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>Never run the engine in an enclosed area or without proper ventilation as the exhaust from the engine contains carbon monoxide, which is an odorless, tasteless, and deadly poisonous gas.</li>
                <li>Store all fuel and oil in containers specifically designed and approved for this purpose and keep away from heat and open flame, and out of the reach of children.</li>
                <li>Replace rubber fuel lines and grommets when worn or damaged and after 5 years of use.</li>
                <li>Fill the gasoline tank outdoors with the engine off and allow the engine to cool completely.  Don't handle gasoline if you or anyone nearby is smoking, or if you're near anything that could cause it to ignite or explode.  Reinstall the fuel tank Cap andfuel container cap securely.</li>
                <li>If you spill gasoline, do not attempt to start the engine.  Move the machine away from the area of the spill and avoid creatingany source of ignition until the gas vapors have dissipated.  Wipe up any spilled fuel to prevent a fire hazard and properly dispose of the waste.</li>
                <li>Allow the engine to cool completely before storing in any enclosure.  Never store a machine that has gas in the tank, or a fuelcontainer, near an open flame or spark such as a water heater, space heater, clothes dryer or furnace.</li>
                <li>Never make adjustments or repairs with the engine running. Shut down the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping it away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, wait 5 minutes before making adjustments or repairs.</li>
                <li>Never tamper with the engine's governor setting.  The governor controls the maximum safe operation speed and protects the engine.  Over-speeding the engine is dangerous and will cause damage to the engine and to the other moving parts of the machine.  If required, see your authorized dealer for engine governor adjustments.</li>
                <li>Keep combustible substances away from the engine when it is hot.</li>
                <li>Never cover the machine while the muffler is still hot.</li>
                <li>Do not operate the engine with the air cleaner or the carburetor air intake cover removed.  Removal of such parts could create a fire hazard.  Do not use flammable solutions to clean the air filter.</li>
                <li>The muffler and engine become very hot and can cause a severe burn; do not touch.</li>
