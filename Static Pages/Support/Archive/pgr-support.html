            <i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
            <p>
                When performing any maintenance, you must first shut off the tow vehicle, set the parking brake and disconnect power from the battery of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader by separating the fuse holder. Read the
                <a href="#safety">safety considerations</a> section of your Owner's Manual before performing any repairs or maintenance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>The wheels on the tow vehicle spin during the grading operation.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The scarifying teeth are set too low, causing too large a section of surface to be removed. Raise the height of the scarifying teeth plate to improve traction.</li>
            <li>There is too much weight in the weight tray. Remove some of the weight.</li>
            <li>The tow vehicle is not adequate for your application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The scarifying teeth are not digging properly.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The angle of the tow bar is not set correctly. Adjust the tow bar up for better grading or adjust the tow bar down for better scarifying.</li>
            <li>There is not enough weight for the hardness of the surface material. Add weight (no more than 80lbs for corded models or 80lbs for EZ-Dial models) to the Power Grader to improve performance.</li>
            <li>The wheels are not lifted all the way up. Raise the wheels completely when grading or scarifying.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The mold board cannot be rotated to alternate angle settings.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The lower hardware is too tight. Loosen the lower bolt and locknut to allow the mold board to rotate during adjustment. Tighten all hardware when angle adjustment is done.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The scarifying teeth plate will not move up or down. (Powered Remote models only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The battery charge is low; charge the battery.</li>
            <li>Check the fuse and replace it if necessary. See your Owner's Manual.</li>
            <li>Loose wire connection. Check the actuator/battery cable connection, and the battery terminal connections, and the Remote Control wire connection.</li>

        <h1>Operating Parameters</h1>
        <p>
            There are four different types of tow vehicles recommended for the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader. Each vehicle type has specific strengths, weaknesses, and operating parameters when used with the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power
            Grader.
        </p>
        <h3>Lawn Tractor/Garden Tractor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>14 HP and/or 400-pound tractor minimum for the 48&quot; Models.</li>
            <li>19 HP and/or 500-pound tractor minimum for the 60&quot; Model.</li>
            <li>5-degree slopes or less.</li>
            <li>Material loosened during grading increases traction difficulties.</li>
            <li>Very good speed control and turning radius.</li>
            <li>Frequent scarifying teeth adjustment may be necessary to maintain traction.</li>
            <li>Forward motion of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader may need to be initiated before ground contact.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ATV</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500cc 4WD ATV recommended for 60&rdquo; Model.</li>
            <li>Traction issues are less evident.</li>
            <li>More difficult to maintain a consistent speed of less than 5 MPH.</li>
            <li>Turning radius is large (best used for large, straight drives).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>UTV</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Traction issues are less evident.</li>
            <li>More difficult to maintain a consistent speed of less than 5 MPH.</li>
            <li>Turning radius is large (best used for large, straight drives).</li>
            <li>The tailgate should be lowered for best visibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Utility Tractor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Traction is excellent.</li>
            <li>Visibility is very good.</li>
            <li>With the increased power, the chance of accidentally damaging the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader's frame is increased. The towing speed MUST be kept less than 5 MPH.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not for Use with Truck or Car</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not use these types of vehicles; the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader is difficult to see.</li>
            <li>NEVER operate the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader with a truck (2WD or 4WD). Use of a truck will void the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader Warranty.</li>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h3>Q: What is the best tow vehicle for the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader?</h3>
        <p>
            A: Of the vehicles we've tested, utility tractors and four wheel drive ATVs perform best. Lawn tractors also work very well (minimum 14 HP/400 lbs. for the 48&quot; models and 19 HP/500 lbs. for the 60&quot; model). The lighter
            the towing vehicle, the more you have to adjust your scraping/grading depth in order to maintain traction. We don't recommend towing the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader with any vehicle where you can't easily see the grader (and
            any obstacles it may encounter).
        </p>
        <h3>Q: How does the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader compare to a box scraper?</h3>
        <p>
            A: Box scrapers usually have 4 or 6 non-hardened scarifying teeth spaced 12&quot; apart. As a result, they are best suited for loosening soil. They don't do a good job penetrating extremely hard driveway surfaces (and their
            non-hardened teeth quickly wear out on these surfaces anyway). That's because they rely solely on the weight of the box scraper to dig - and on hard surfaces that's just not enough.
        </p>
        <h3>Q: What won't the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader do?</h3>
        <p>
            A: It won't grade areas covered with tall, thick vegetation. The vegetation will clog the scarifying teeth, making them ineffective. Similarly, if the area you are grading has a lot of rocks, the machine will perform better if
            you remove rocks that surface as you're grading. Finally the Power Grader is not designed to move snow.
        </p>
        <h3>Q: Can the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader create a crown in the road?</h3>
        <p>A: No, but you can maintain a crown in the road by grading each side separately.</p>
        <h3>Q: Can the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader ruin the crown in the road?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes, but only if you grade down the centerline of the road.</p>
        <h3>Q: Can I use my lawn tractor in sandy soils?</h3>
        <p>A: Lawn tractors do not perform as well as an ATV or Utility Tractor in sandy soils.</p>
        <h3>Q: How long will the teeth last?</h3>
        <p>
            A: We graded over 100 miles of rock-hard limestone roads with no visible wear on the carbide-tipped teeth. This same material is used on well drilling bits and excavating equipment. It will last for an extremely long time. If
            you do manage to wear out or damage the teeth, they are easily replaced.
        </p>
        <h3>Q: How often do I need to recharge the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader's battery? (Powered Remote models only)</h3>
        <p>
            A: We tested the actuator to over 800 cycles without any loss of power, so you won't need to charge it very often. When you do charge the battery, just plug it into any 110-volt outlet overnight. The battery charger is included
            with the machine. When you are done using the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader, we recommend disconnecting the battery.

        <h3>The following information is provided to demonstrate proper techniques when operating your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader.</h3>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This information pertains to the most recent DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Graders. Please refer to your Safety &amp; Owner's Manual for instructions specific to your machine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
            <p>Clean out the bottom of the battery holder completely before re-installing the battery. (Powered Remote models only)</p>
            <p>Lower the grader frame completely to the ground surface when transporting on a trailer, parking on a hill, or servicing the grader.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use additional weight (up to 80 lbs for Powered Remote models, 80 lbs for EZ-Dial models) in the weight tray when grading hard pack to begin scarification.</li>
            <li>Remove weight when the surface material loosens or when experiencing traction difficulties.</li>
            <li>Remove the weight when grading in muddy conditions or sandy soil.</li>
            <li>Expect to make several passes with the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader to repair a roadway, depending on the condition.</li>
            <li>Avoid filling pot holes filled with water, wait until the holes are dry.</li>
            <li>Use the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader to work the edges of pot holes that are more than 4 feet wide to loosen the sides before you begin filling them.</li>
            <li>Avoid large rocks, embedded ledge, cattle guards, or similar obstructions.</li>
            <li>Remove rocks pulled to the surface during grading to provide a better final graded surface; They can catch under the lawn deck (for lawn tractors).</li>
            <li>Once you have adequately scarified the road surface, angle the hitch upward to raise the scarifying teeth to allow the mold board to create a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>Raise the scarifying teeth plate/tooth bar out of the ground before turning around or leaving the work area.</li>
            <li>
                The mold board can be mounted with the straight edge down for basic grading or for creating smoother surfaces in finer materials. It can also be mounted with the grooved edge down for more aggressive grading or for creating
                grooved surfaces in finer materials.
            </li>
            <li>To create a smoother surface in soft materials, the axle assembly can be positioned on top of the grader to prevent tire tracks.(EZ-Dial Model Only)</li>
            <li>
                When using a lawn tractor as the tow vehicle, put the lawn mowing deck in the highest setting or remove the deck to obtain the highest ground clearance. For ease, do your spring grading before re-installing your lawn deck
                for the summer mowing activity.
            </li>
            <li>When using the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Grader to prepare a seed bed, remove all large debris before grading. Use the optional drag screen to create the best finish in sand or to incorporate seed.</li>
            <li>Use low gear when using an ATV as the tow vehicle - Do not exceed 5 MPH while grading.</li>
            <li>The maximum speed when not grading is 10 MPH.</li>
