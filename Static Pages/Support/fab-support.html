		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h3>Q: Does the machine arrive fully assembled?</h3>
		<p>A: Minimal assembly is required. You'll need to slide the power unit shaft into the brush deck and attach the blade belt. This takes a maximum of 5 to 10 minutes. For electric-start models, you'll also need to connect the battery wire. Consult your Owner's Manual for easy instructions.</p>
		<h3>Q: Can I safely mow on hills?</h3>
		<p>A: You can safely mow on slopes up to 20&deg; with walk-behind models and tow-behind models.</p>
		<h3>Q: How long can I mow using the standard 2-1/2 gallon gas tank?</h3>
		<p>A: How long a tank of gas will last will vary depending on conditions, but generally the 2-1/2 gallon tank will last approximately 2-3 hours.</p>
		<h3>Q: Are the tires puncture resistant?</h3>
		<p>A: Yes. The tires are filled with a liquid sealant that fills punctures and prevents leaking.</p>
		<h3>Q: What is the cutting height?</h3>
		<p>A: Our walk-behind models have a fixed, 3-1/2&quot; cutting height. The cutting height on our Tow-Behind models can be adjusted to 4&quot; through 7-1/2&quot;.</p>
		<h3>Q: How are DR<sup>&reg;</sup> products shipped?</h3>
		<p>A: We offer 3 basic options:<br>
		1) Delivery to a Depot<br>

			<p>The mower engine's power can easily throw stones, sticks, and other debris at great velocity, which could cause personal injury or property damage. Do not run the machine over mulch, gravel driveways or loose stones with the mower blade spinning.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Slopes, obstacles and terrain</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Always check your work area before mowing and remove any debris that might tangle or damage the machine.</li>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> If you need to leave the operating position to clear debris from the mower deck, disengage the blade, set the brake, turn off the engine and disconnect the spark plug wire(s).</li>
			<li><em>For Tow-Behind Models:</em> If you need to leave the tow vehicle to clear debris from the mower deck, set the parking brake, shut off the tow vehicle engine, disengage the mower blades, turn off the engine and disconnect the spark plug wire(s).</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Cutting brush and saplings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When cutting woody material, small saplings, etc., allow the machine to ride up and over material slowly. Adjust your forward speed for varying conditions.</li>
			<li>After cutting brush, etc., you may want to mow over it again to remove any remaining branches. It works best to mow from the trunk end toward the top as brush lies on the ground.</li>
			<li>When you are cutting high grass or brush, be sure to keep the uncut material to your left, maintaining a clear discharge area to your right. To further mulch material, overlap half of the cutting swath in your next pass.</li>
			<li><em>For Tow-Behind Models:</em> If you are using offset mowing, keep the offset at 75% when cutting heavy brush.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>If the machine is hung up</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Disengage the blade. NEVER try to free the machine from stumps or debris with the blade engaged.</li>
			<li>Try putting the machine in reverse and backing away from the obstacle.</li>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> Try pushing down on the handlebars to lift the mowing deck over the obstacle.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Reverse gear</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> Be very careful of your footing when operating the machine in reverse. Know what's behind you and take your time.</li>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> Disengage the blade before shifting into reverse. Mow in the forward gears only, using reverse for maneuvering.</li>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> If you find it difficult to shift into reverse, lightly &quot;feather&quot; the clutch lever as you put the shift lever into reverse, then quickly release the clutch lever.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Cutting in wet and heavy growth</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid steep slopes and other slippery areas.</li>
			<li>Slow down. Use a lower gear when mowing in wet conditions.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Cold weather operation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> At temperatures below 30&deg; F and a high dew point, your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Field and Brush Mower engine may experience icing of the carburetor and/or the crankcase breather system. We offer an optional engine cover to prevent icing in these weather conditions. The cover can be purchased through our <a href="/power-equipment/field-brush-mowers/accessories/">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Field and Brush Mower accessories page</a>.
			</li>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Models:</em> As a preventative measure to prevent control cable freeze up: prior to using your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Field and Brush Mower in cold weather, inject &quot;dry gas&quot; into the brake, and clutch cable-housing openings to absorb any moisture that may have collected. Tip the machine forward slightly so the &quot;dry gas&quot; will flow down the inside of the housings, and then lubricate as outlined in your Owner's Manual.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Operating on slopes</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
			<p>Slopes are a major factor related to slip and fall accidents, which can result in severe injury. All slopes require caution. If you feel uneasy on a slope, do not mow it. Always take the following precautions when using this machine on slopes:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li><em>For Walk-Behind Series:</em> Mow across the face of slopes; never up and down. Exercise extreme caution when changing direction on slopes.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Safety with gasoline-powered machines</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
			<p>Gasoline is a highly flammable liquid. Gasoline also gives off flammable vapor that can be easily ignited and cause a fire or explosion. Never overlook the hazards of gasoline. Always follow these precautions:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Never run the engine in an enclosed area or without proper ventilation as the exhaust from the engine contains carbon monoxide, which is an odorless, tasteless, and deadly poisonous gas.</li>
			<li>Store all fuel and oil in containers specifically designed and approved for this purpose and keep away from heat and open flame, and out of the reach of children.</li>
			<li>Fill the gasoline tank outdoors with the engine off and allow the engine to cool completely. Do not handle gasoline if you or anyone nearby is smoking, or if you're near anything that could cause it to ignite or explode. Replace the fuel tank and fuel container caps securely.</li>
			<li>If you spill gasoline, do not attempt to start the engine. Move the machine away from the area of the spill and avoid creating any source of ignition until the gas vapors have dissipated. Wipe up any spilled fuel to prevent a fire hazard and properly dispose of the waste.</li>
			<li>Allow the engine to cool completely and empty the collector box before storing in any enclosure. Never store the machine with gas in the tank or a fuel container, near an open flame or spark such as a water heater.</li>
			<li>Never make adjustments or repairs with the engine running. Before making an adjustment or repair, shut off the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Field and Brush Mower engine, wait five (5) minutes to cool, then disconnect the spark plug wire(s) and keep the wire(s) away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting.</li>
			<li>Never check for an ignition spark with the spark plug or spark plug wire(s) removed. Always use an approved spark plug tester.</li>
			<li>Never tamper with safety devices. Regularly check their proper operation.</li>
			<li>Never tamper with the engine's governor setting or modify the engine speed. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed and protects the engine. Over-speeding the engine is dangerous and will cause damage to the engine and to the other moving parts of the machine. If required, see your authorized engine dealer for engine governor adjustments.</li>
			<li>To reduce fire hazard, keep the engine and muffler area free of debris build-up such as leaves, grass, oil, grease, or any other combustible material. Clean the engine area after each use.</li>
			<li>Never operate the engine with the air cleaner or cover over the carburetor air intake removed, except for adjustment. Removal of such parts could create a fire hazard. Do not use flammable solutions to clean the air filter.</li>
			<li>Always check fuel lines and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks, replace if necessary.</li>

		<h1>End of Season and Storage</h1>
		<p>The following information is provided to demonstrate proper techniques when storing your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Field and Brush Mower.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please refer to the Engine Owner's Manual for engine-specific procedures.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
			<p>Before performing any maintenance procedure, stop the engine, wait five (5) minutes for all parts to stop and cool. Disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping it away from the spark plug.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>End-of-Season Procedure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Change the engine oil (and oil filter, if applicable). For winter use, use SAE 5W - 30 HD.</li>
			<li>Remove the spark plug(s) and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull the recoil starter rope (if equipped) or crank the engine over using the electric start. This will coat the piston and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
			<li>Clean/replace the air filter(s).</li>
			<li>Clean dirt and debris from the cylinder head cooling fins, blower housing, debris screens, and muffler area of the engine.</li>
			<li>If your engine has a fuel filter, replace it.</li>
			<li>Remove any wrapped weeds from the blade bearing housing. Clean grass and debris from the top and underneath the mower Deck with a stiff brush.</li>
			<li>Check the blade(s) for nicks and wear. Remove the blade(s) and sharpen, or have it professionally sharpened if needed.</li>
			<li>Perform the lubrication as outlined in your Owner's Manual.</li>
			<li>Touch up all rusted or chipped paint surfaces. Sand them lightly before painting.</li>
			<li>Be sure all nuts, bolts, and screws are securely fastened.</li>
			<li>Inspect moving parts and the blade(s) drive belt for damage and wear; replace if necessary.</li>
			<li>Store the battery in a dry area that will not freeze. If you will not use the machine over a long period, charge the battery every four to six weeks. See your Owner's Manual for battery care.</li>
			<li>If your machine will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/shop-by-category/maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up on the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate.

			<li>If possible, store your machine inside, but not near an open flame or spark such as found in a water heater.</li>
			<li>After the machine has cooled, cover the machine with a suitable protective cover that does not retain moisture. Do not use plastic as this material cannot breathe; it also allows condensation to form, which will cause your machine to rust.</li>
