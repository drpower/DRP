                <li>There may be an oil compression lock in the cylinder. Take out the spark plug, hold a rag over the spark plug hole, and pull the recoil cord several times to blow out any oil in the cylinder. Wipe off the spark plug and reinstall it.</li>

                <li>Check the throttle adjustment and travel. (See your Owner's Manual.)</li>

                <li>Check the wire connections to the solenoid. Disconnect the black battery ground wire first to avoid sparks. Check to be sure that all of the connections are clean and tight. Reconnect the battery ground wire.</li>
                <li>Check the ground connection on the solenoid where it's bolted to the frame. Using a wrench or socket, tighten the bolts to ensure a good connection to the frame.</li>
                <li>The battery should be charged. Check the voltage yourself or at a gas station. If it's low, charge it with a 12-volt, 1 to 2 Amp trickle charger. If you don't use your vacuum for at least 45 minutes at a time, the battery may need to be periodically charged. See the Battery Care section in your Owner's Manual.</li>

                <li>Check the wire connections to the solenoid. Disconnect the black battery ground wire first to avoid sparks. Check to be sure that all of the connections are clean and tight. Reconnect the battery ground wire.</li>
                <li>Check the ground connection on the solenoid where it's bolted to the frame. Using a wrench or socket, tighten the bolts to ensure a good connection to the frame.</li>
                <li>The battery may not be charged. Check the voltage yourself or at a gas station. If it's low, charge it with a 12-volt, 1 to 2 Amp trickle charger. If you don't use your vacuum for at least 45 minutes at a time, the battery may need to be periodically charged. See the Battery Care section in your Owner's Manual.</li>

              <p>Pick up stones, metal objects, glass and sticks before vacuuming.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Efficient uses of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum</h2>
            <span class="alt-header-support">For the most efficient use of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum, use this sequence of steps:</span>
            <ol>
              <li>Gather and pile sticks for chipping.</li>
              <li>Chip the smaller sticks and branches.</li>
              <li>Remove the rear panel and load the larger limbs.</li>
              <li>Dump the load at the desired location.</li>
              <li>Mow and vacuum leaves.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Be careful in corners</h2>
            <p>Practice in first gear to understand the effects of the trailer on your ability to turn sharply. Drive your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum into the corner of your property and back out straight to mow as close to the corner as possible. Be sure to say away from fences when you want to turn, as the back will swing wide during a turn. Avoid going through ditches.</p>
            <h2>Vacuum with the discharge side toward the leaves</h2>
            <p>The lawn deck will tend to scatter some leaves in front and to the right of the lawn deck. Keeping the discharge side toward the remaining leaves will simplify cleanup by avoiding blowing leaves back onto the areas that you already finished. When you need to vacuum with the discharge side toward the completed area of the lawn, then overlap the discharge side of the lawn deck at least a foot over the already completed section of the lawn.</p>
            <h2>Keep grass length and cutting height low for optimal performance</h2>
            <p>To prevent clogging the lawn deck adapter and vacuum hose, mow grass that is dry and not more 2&quot; at a time. To keep your grass healthy, we recommend cutting less than 1/3 the grass height.</p>
            <h2>Maximize lift from your lawn deck</h2>
            <p>Run your lawn deck with your Tractor at full throttle all the time to maximize the lift from your lawn deck and assist your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum system.</p>
            <h2>Watch for curbs, stonewalls, and debris</h2>
            <p>Avoid dragging the inlet hose over curbs, stonewalls, or piles of cut branches. The hose is tough, but can puncture on sharp objects. This could also crack the mower deck adapter.</p>

                <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Walk-Behind Leaf and Lawn Vacuum will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/shop-by-category/maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate.</li>
                <li>Remove the spark plug and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull the recoil starter rope until you feel strong resistance. This will coat the piston and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
                <li>Clean or replace the air filter.</li>
                <li>Clean dirt and debris from the cylinder head cooling fins, impeller housing, debris screen, and muffler area of the engine.</li>
                <li>Clean the debris bag. For step-by-step instructions on removing and emptying the debris bag, see your Owner's Manual.</li>
                <li>For electric-start models, store the battery in a dry area that will not freeze. If you will not use the machine over a long period, charge the battery every four to six weeks. See your Owner's Manual for more information on battery care.</li>

                <li>If you are going to use the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum Tow-Behind as a trailer during the end of season, we recommend that you remove and store the engine in a dry location. (See your Owner's Manual for removal of the Blower/Chipper Unit.)</li>
                <li>For minimal storage space, or if you store outside, you can disassemble the collector box by removing the rear &amp; front panels, centrifugal separator (top), and the side panels. The collector box pieces then can be stacked against a wall in a convenient location. (See your Owner's Manual disassembly and re-assembly of the collector box.)</li>
