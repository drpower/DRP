    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h3>Q: Among the available models, what are the differences among the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chippers?</h3>
    <p>A: Because they use the power of your tractor (up to 65 HP), the PTO models potentially offer the maximum power and speed. But if you need a stand-alone machine with its own engine, the 21.0 Self-Feeding model will devour just about anything up to 5-3/4&quot; in diameter.</p>
    <h3>Q: How are DR<sup>&reg;</sup> products shipped?</h3>
    <p>A: We offer 3 basic options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delivery to a Depot</li>
      <li>Delivery to Home or Business</li>
      <li>Enhanced Home Delivery</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Q: How often do the chipper knives require sharpening?</h3>
    <p>A: Because our knives are made of high-carbon/high-chromium forged alloy tool steel, they can go significantly longer than the knives on most &quot;bargain&quot; chippers without sharpening. Still, as with any cutting tool, keeping a sharp edge is important for maintaining peak performance. How long you can go without sharpening will vary considerably with the amount of chipping you do and the type of material you are chipping. When the chipper starts to slow down and requires that you regularly force the material downward, it's usually a sign that the knife is dulling. Many customers choose to get an extra knife to have on hand. That way, you can keep working with minimal downtime.</p>
    <h3>Q: What happens if my machine needs service?</h3>
    <p>A: Our knowledgeable representatives have an extensive understanding of the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Chipper and Chipper/Shredder and will be able to identify the problem and the best solution. If necessary, we can have replacement parts shipped to you right away, or direct you to one of our authorized DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Service Centers nationwide.</p>
    <h3>Q: How does your 6 Month Hands-On Trial work?</h3>
    <p>A: We are so confident you'll love your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machine that we want you to be able to try it out on your own property virtually risk-free. If at any time during the first 6 months of owning your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> (6 months from the date it ships) you decide that it isn't right for you, or wish to exchange it for a different model, we will take it back, no questions asked, for a full refund, less shipping to and from your delivery location. <a href="/pages/content/customer-support/shopping-resources/trial">See more information here.</a></p>
    <h3>Q: How does my warranty work?</h3>
    <p>A: DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machines come with a 2-year warranty (for residential use, 90 days for commercial use) that covers all defects in materials and workmanship. Extended warranties (1-year, 2-year, and 3-year) are available to extend your coverage for a total of up to 5 years. If, while your machine is under warranty, you experience a problem with your machine, your warranty will cover the replacement and installation of any non-wearable parts deemed to be the result of defective materials or workmanship. <a href="/pages/content/customer-support/shopping-resources/warranty">See more information here.</a></p>

    <h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
    <h3>The following information is provided to demonstrate proper techniques when operating your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper.</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> This information pertains to the most recent DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper models. Please refer to your Safety &amp; Owner's Manual for instructions specific to your machine. Please refer to the Engine Owner's Manual for engine specific instructions.</div>
    <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      <p>Always wear protective goggles or safety glasses with side shields while chipping to protect your eyes from possible thrown debris.</p>
      <p>Avoid wearing loose clothing or jewelry, which might catch on moving parts or the material fed into the chipper hopper.</p>
      <p>We recommend wearing gloves while chipping. Be sure your gloves fit properly and do not have loose cuffs or drawstrings.</p>
      <p>Wear shoes with non-slip treads when using your chipper. If you have safety shoes, we recommend wearing them. Do not use the machine while barefoot or wearing open sandals.</p>
      <p>Wear long pants while operating the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper.</p>
      <p>Use ear protectors or ear plugs rated for at least 20 dBA to protect your hearing.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Processing Material</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The chipper is designed to accept wood only. The chipper knife mounted on a revolving flywheel turns branches fed into the chipper hopper into &quot;chips&quot;. The chipper can chip branches ranging in size up to 5-3/4&quot; in diameter. Cut your materials into manageable lengths before feeding them into the chipper hopper.
        <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
          <p>The chipper hopper must be securely bolted to your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper and the blowback shield in place before using the machine!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>Use common sense when using the machine. Learn to recognize the change in sounds when overloaded. Turn off the engine immediately if the machine becomes jammed to prevent damage to the drive system.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper can process dry or green wood up to 5-3/4&quot; in diameter.</li>
      <li>The chipper will self-feed the wood once it contacts the knife edge so forcing the branches into the hopper is not necessary if the knife is sharp.</li>
      <li>Green material will process quicker and easier than dry material.</li>
      <li>Softwood processes easier than hardwood.</li>
      <li>When chipping branches, sometimes a tail will develop at the end of a branch. To avoid this, rotate the branch while feeding it into the chipper hopper.</li>
      <li>Rotating the branch as you feed it into the machine will improve chipping performance.</li>
      <li>Use caution with small diameter green saplings and branches less than 2&quot; in diameter. Chip these grouped or bundled together to provide support for each other. If the material is 2&quot; or larger, feed only one at a time into the chipper hopper.</li>
      <li>Make sure the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper finishes processing material in the Hopper before shutting the engine off.</li>
      <li>Do not force material into the chipper. If the machine does not chip well, the knife may need sharpening or replacement, or the gap between the knife and the wear plate needs adjusting. See &quot;Removing, Replacing and Adjusting the Chipper Knife and Wear Plate&quot; in your Owner's Manual.
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>Never throw remaining stubs or knots into the chipper hopper; damage will result.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Extremely hard knots will not process very well. Push any short stubs that have not self-fed through the chipper, with the next branch to be chipped.</li>
      <li>Cut the material to be chipped into manageable lengths of no more than five or six feet long before chipping them. As the branch or tree is fed into the chipper hopper, keep it at the same angle as the hopper for optimal chipping performance</li>
      <li>Overloading the chipper hopper will cause the rotor speed to decrease. If you hear the engine RPM decreasing, stop feeding material into the chipper hopper until the engine has returned to full speed.</li>
      <li>Always wear gloves when chipping. This can prevent blisters and scrapes and help reduce the effects of vibration as you chip. Properly fitting leather or lined gloves work best.</li>
      <li>Run the engine at full throttle when chipping. If the chipping action seems too slow, the engine speed may be too slow causing the belt to slip.</li>
      <li>Feed branches with green leaves and conifer/pine boughs slowly and shut off the engine immediately if the chipper begins to clog.</li>
      <li>When feeding material into the chipper hopper, be careful that pieces of metal, rock or other foreign objects are not included.</li>
      <li>If the cutting mechanism strikes a foreign object or if the machine should start making an unusual noise or vibration, immediately shut off the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop (the flywheel will continue rotating for while after the engine is shut down), disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping the wire away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, then wait 5 minutes before inspecting for clogging or damage. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble. Clean and repair and/or replace damaged parts. See your Owner's Manual for detailed instructions.</li>
      <li>If the machine becomes clogged, the belt smokes or burns or the flywheel won't turn, immediately shut down the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop (the flywheel will continue rotating for while after the engine is shut down), disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping the wire away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, disconnect the negative battery cable, then wait 5 minutes before removing processed material, leaves, or debris from the machine. See your Owner's Manual for detailed instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Three-Point Hitch Models</h2>
    <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      <p>Disengage the PTO, shut down the tractor engine, remove the key, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop, disconnect the PTO shaft from the tractor, then wait 5 minutes before performing any maintenance procedure or inspection on the chipper. Read the <a href="#safety">safety considerations</a> section of your Owner's Manual before performing any repairs or maintenance.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>The DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Three-Point Hitch Chipper is designed to be run with the weight of the unit on level ground. Chipping with the unit off the ground or on uneven ground can result in injury to the operator or others, or unsatisfactory chipping performance.</li>
      <li>To activate the chipper, engage the PTO drive with the tractor running at idle. Gradually increase tractor engine speed until you achieve a PTO speed of 540 RPM. PTO speeds less than 540 RPM will result in poor chipping performance. Chipping with greater than 540 RPM can damage the equipment.</li>
      <li>Whenever you leave the operating position or if you have to remove processed material, leaves, or debris from the machine, always disengage the PTO, shut down the tractor, remove the key, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop, disconnect the PTO shaft from the tractor, then wait 5 minutes before removing processed material, leaves, or debris from the machine.</li>

Inserting these objects into the chipper hopper could damage the machine and/or cause injury. This is a high-powered machine, with moving parts operating at high energy at high speeds. You must use proper clothing and safety gear when operating this machine to prevent or minimize the risk of severe injury. This machine can crush, grind, cut, and sever parts of your body if they enter the inlet or discharge area of your chipper.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Safety Rules</h2>
    <h3>Labels</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper carries prominent labels as reminders for its proper and safe use. Your Owner's Manual shows copies of all the labels that appear on the equipment. Take a moment to study them and make a note of their location on your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper as you assemble and before you operate the machine. Replace damaged or missing safety and information labels immediately.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Protecting yourself and others around you</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>This is a high-powered machine, with moving parts operating at high energy at high speeds. You must use proper clothing and safety gear when operating this machine to prevent or minimize the risk of severe injury. This machine can cut and sever parts of your body if they become in contact with the moving chipper blades. Always take the following precautions when operating this machine:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>

      <li>Wear shoes with non-slip treads when using your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper. If you have safety shoes, we recommend wearing them. Do not use the machine while barefoot or wearing open sandals.</li>
      <li>Avoid wearing loose clothing or jewelry, which can catch on the machine's moving parts or material fed into the chipper hopper.</li>
      <li>We recommend wearing long pants and gloves while using your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper. Be sure your gloves fit properly and do not have loose cuffs or drawstrings.</li>
      <li>We recommend the use of ear protectors or ear plugs rated for at least 20 dBA to protect your hearing.</li>
      <li>Allow only responsible individuals who are familiar with these general safety rules and operating instructions to use your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper. Never allow people who are unfamiliar with these instructions to use the machine.</li>
      <li>Never place your hands, feet, or any part of your body in the chipper hopper, discharge opening, or near or under any moving part while the machine is running. Keep area of discharge clear of people, animals, buildings, glass or anything else that will obstruct clear discharge, cause injury, or damage. Wind can also change discharge direction, so be aware. If it becomes necessary to push material into the chipper hopper, use a small diameter stick, not your hands.</li>
      <li>Keep bystanders at least 100 feet away from your work area at all times. Wood chips exit the chipper at great speeds. To be safe, do not operate the machine near small children or pets, and never allow children to operate the chipper. Disengage the PTO (if applicable), stop the engine (and tractor engine, if applicable) when another person or pet approaches.</li>
      <li>The flywheel will still rotate for a while after the engine is shut off. Shut down the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop, wait 5 minutes, then remove the spark plug wire before moving or working on the chipper.</li>
      <li>Never use the machine without ensuring that all guards and shields are in place, including the chipper hopper, discharge chute and blowback shield. Do not alter or tamper with safety devices or shields.</li>
      <li>Do not operate the engine with the air cleaner or the carburetor air-intake cover removed. Removal of such parts could create a fire hazard. Do not use flammable solutions to clean the air filter.</li>
      <li>Always operate the machine from the operator zone (see &quot;Operation Notes&quot; in your Owner's Manual). Never pass or stand on the discharge side of the machine when the engine (or tractor engine, if applicable) is running or the flywheel is turning.</li>
      <li>Never try to pick up, move, or transport the machine with the PTO engaged (if applicable) or while the engine is running or the flywheel is turning. Shut down the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop (the flywheel will continue rotating for a while after the engine is shut down), disconnect spark plug wire, keeping it away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, then wait 5 minutes before moving.</li>
      <li>Do not touch the exhaust area, including the muffler and engine when the machine is in use as they become very hot and can cause a severe burn. Allow the engine to cool before doing maintenance or making adjustments.</li>
      <li>Clear the area of object such as wire and rope, etc. Inserting these objects into the chipper hopper could damage the flywheel and/or cause injury</li>
      <li>Never, under any conditions, remove, bend, cut, fit, weld, or otherwise alter standard parts on the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper. This includes all shields and guards. Modifications to your machine could cause personal injuries and property damage and will void your warranty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Safety for children and pets</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>Tragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children or pets. Children are often attracted to the tractor and the chipping activity. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them. Always follow these precautions:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep children and pets at least 100 feet from the working area and ensure they are under the watchful care of a responsible adult.</li>
      <li>Be alert and always turn the machine off if children or pets enter the work area.</li>
      <li>Never allow children to operate the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Safety with gasoline-powered machines (for self-feeding models)</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>Gasoline is a highly flammable liquid. Gasoline also gives off flammable vapor that can be easily ignited and cause a fire or explosion. Never overlook the hazards of gasoline. Always follow these precautions:</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Never run the engine in an enclosed area or without proper ventilation as the exhaust from the engine contains carbon monoxide, which is an odorless, tasteless, and deadly poisonous gas.</li>
      <li>Store all fuel and oil in containers specifically designed and approved for this purpose and keep away from heat and open flame, and out of the reach of children.</li>
      <li>Always check fuel lines and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks. Replace when worn or damaged and after 5 years of use.</li>
      <li>Fill the gasoline tank outdoors with the engine off and allow the engine to cool completely. Do not handle gasoline if you or anyone nearby is smoking, or if you're near anything that could cause it to ignite or explode. Replace the fuel tank and fuel container caps securely.</li>
      <li>If you spill gasoline, do not attempt to start the engine. Move the machine away from the area of the spill and avoid creating any source of ignition until the gas vapors have dissipated. Wipe up any spilled fuel to prevent a fire hazard and properly dispose of the waste.</li>
      <li>Allow the engine to cool completely before storing the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper in any enclosure. Never store the machine with gas in the tank or a fuel container, near an open flame or spark such as a water heater, space heater, clothes dryer or furnace.</li>
      <li>Never make adjustments or repairs with the engine running or the flywheel turning. Shut down the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop (the flywheel will continue rotating for while after the engine is shut down), disconnect the spark plug wire, keeping it wire away from the spark plug to prevent accidental starting, then wait 5 minutes before making adjustments or repairs.</li>
      <li>Never check for an ignition spark with the spark plug or spark plug wire removed. Always use an approved spark plug tester.</li>
      <li>Never tamper with the engine's governor setting or modify the engine speed. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed and protects the engine. Over-speeding the engine is dangerous and will cause damage to the engine and to the other moving parts of the machine. If required, see your authorized engine dealer for engine governor adjustments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Towing Safety (for self-feeding models installed with optional road-towing package)</h3>
    <p><strong>Always take the following precautions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before towing, be certain the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper is correctly and securely attached to the towing vehicle and the safety chains are in place. Leave slack in the chains to allow for turning.</li>
      <li>Never allow people or pets to ride on the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper.</li>
      <li>Never transport anything on the machine.</li>
      <li>Obey local, state, and federal regulations when you tow the chipper on public roads and highways.
        <div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> Some states require the machine to be registered with the State Department of Motor Vehicles.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Allow for added length in driving situations, e.g., when turning, parking, and crossing intersections.</li>
      <li>Adjust your towing speed for terrain and conditions. Do not exceed 45 MPH while towing the chipper.</li>
      <li>Towing the machine can affect the handling of the tow vehicle:
        <ul>
          <li>The chipper might track at an angle to the tow vehicle.</li>
          <li>The machine can turn tighter than the tow vehicle.</li>
          <li>Never back up the tow vehicle with the chipper attached. The machine can jackknife, causing damage to itself and/or the tow vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Long distance towing is not recommended. The DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Wood Chipper does not have springs to absorb road shock and will tend to bounce on rough roads. Extended towing can cause unnecessary wear.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Shut down the engine, wait for all moving parts to come to a complete stop, wait 5 minutes and remove spark plug wire before performing any maintenance procedure or inspection on the chipper</p>
        <p>Never store the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Self-Feeding Chipper with fuel in the fuel tank inside a building where ignition sources are present, such as hot water and space heaters, clothes dryers and the like. If you are going to drain the fuel tank, do this outdoors. Allow the engine to cool before storing in any enclosure.</p>
        <p>When not in use, your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Self-Feeding Chipper should be stored out of the reach of children.</p>
        <p>Read the <a href="#safety">safety considerations</a> section of your Owner's Manual before performing any repairs or maintenance.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>End-of-Season Procedure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the oil (and oil filter, if applicable).</li>
        <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Self-Feeding Chipper will be idle for more than 30 days, we recommend using <a href="/shop-by-category/maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd">DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent sediment from gumming up the carburetor. If there is dirt or moisture in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank. Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment. Run the engine for a short time to allow the additive to circulate. Close the fuel shut-off valve to prevent carburetor overflow and leakage.</li>
        <li>Remove the spark plug and pour about 1 ounce of motor oil into the cylinder hole. Reinstall the plug and pull the starter cord a few times. This will coat the pistons and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>
        <li>Clean or replace the air filter.</li>
        <li>Lubricate all grease fittings.</li>
        <li>Clean any dirt and debris from the cylinder head cooling fins, blower housing, debris screen and muffler area of the engine.</li>
        <li>If your engine has a fuel filter, replace it.</li>
        <li>Check the drive belt for wear.</li>
        <li>Check the chipper knife and wear plate for nicks and wear.</li>
        <li>For electric start models remove the battery or store your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Self-Feeding Chipper in a dry environment where the temperature is between -10&deg; F (-23&deg; C) and +85&deg; F (+23&deg; C). Make sure the storage temperatures will never be outside these limits.</li>
        <li>Clean any debris from the hopper and discharge chute.</li>
