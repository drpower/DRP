    <h2>IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>Due to a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court, effective July 1, 2018, businesses conducting internet sales and phone sales are now required to collect sales tax in states that have enacted such laws. Sales tax will be collected based on the state the product was delivered and will be remitted back to the same state. States without such laws may require us to send you and the State notification of your purchases at year end, as well as remind you of the obligation to pay any sales tax due with your personal income tax return. Sales tax exemptions can only be requested by submission of a valid sales tax exemption certificate issued by your State tax department in advance to DR Power Equipment, 800 Hinesburg Road, S. Burlington, VT 05403. Sorry no exceptions.</p>
    <p> We are unable to process sales tax exemptions for on-line orders. If your order is tax exemption eligible it must be placed though our call center at 1-800-687-6575 and you will be required to provide a valid exemption certificate. Once an order is processed, we are unable to refund sales tax and you must contact your state's tax department with refund requests.</p>
