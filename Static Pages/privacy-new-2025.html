            In this section, we provide information for California residents, as required under California privacy laws,
            including the California Consumer Privacy Act (&ldquo;
            <strong>
                CCPA

            &rdquo;), which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how we
            handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline. Under the CCPA, &ldquo;personal
            information&rdquo; is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being
            associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California
            resident or household.

            The following sub-sections below, read together, are intended to comply with our obligations for Notice at
            Collection under the CCPA:

            </strong>
            This section applies to &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; as defined by the CCPA, whether collected
            online or offline, in our capacity as a business. This section does not address or apply to our handling of
            publicly available information or personal information that is otherwise exempt under the CCPA. This section
            also does not apply to personal information we collect about job applicants, independent contractors, or
            current or former full-time, part-time and temporary employees and staff, officers, directors or owners of
            Generac; different notices apply.

            </strong>
            The table below sets out generally the categories of personal information (as defined by the CCPA) about
            California residents that we may collect and disclose to others for a business or commercial purpose. Our
            collection and disclosure of personal information about a California resident will vary depending upon the
            circumstances and nature of our interactions or relationship with such residents.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table also sets out how we &ldquo;sell&rdquo; and &ldquo;share&rdquo; personal information. The CCPA
            defines &ldquo;sale&rdquo; as disclosing or making available personal information to a third party in
            exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; includes disclosing or
            making available personal information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
            We may disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for valuable consideration or monetary
            compensation. We may also &ldquo;sell&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; as described in the table below to
            third-party advertising networks and analytics providers for purposes of marketing and advertising and to
            improve and measure our ad campaigns. Please note that we do not sell or share personal information about
            individuals we know are under age sixteen (16).

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you submit a request, we will take steps to verify your identity and request by matching the
            information provided by you with the information we have in our records. In some cases, we may request
            additional information in order to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we
            are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will
            explain the basis for the denial.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may also designate someone as an authorized agent to submit requests and act on your behalf. Authorized
            agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization in their first communication with us, and we
            may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the
            authorized agent.

            We may make available programs or offerings, and other sweepstakes, contests, or similar promotional
            offerings (each a &ldquo;
            <strong>

                Rewards and Offers

            disclose, and retain personal information about individuals as part of these Programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Programs may involve making available Rewards and Offers to customers and partners that participate in
            a customer satisfaction or market research survey or requests for feedback. To participate in these
            Programs, you must register and provide us with certain personal information, which may include identifiers
            (i.e., name, email, address, and other similar contact information), and any feedback or responses. Some of
            these Programs may be administered by third party partners who may collect or receive your personal
            information to administer the Program and provide related services to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a basis for offering these Rewards and Offers, we have valued the personal information we collect based
            on a reasonable and good faith calculation determined by considering expenses related to the Programs. In
            doing so, we value the personal information collected through the programs as the equivalent of the costs
            and expenses incurred to provide the Program, including IT, administration, direct costs, third party costs,
            discounts, and service development costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We disclose the personal information collected for purposes of administering our Programs and consistent

        </p>
        <p>
            You may withdraw from a Program at any time by contacting us at privacy@generac.com. Please note that if you
            withdraw from a Program (or submit a CCPA request to delete your information), your participation in that
            Program will be terminated, which means that you will no longer be eligible to earn, use, access, or redeem
            any Program Rewards and Offers, subject to the applicable Program terms.
