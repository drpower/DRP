LLC, the leading battery powered, commercial grade turf care manufacturer, headquartered in Ross,
Ohio.</p>

<p>

in an innovative and differentiated way. The improvements in battery technology have now enabled the
electrification of large commercial turf care products and Mean Green is leading the way” said Matt
Bieber, President of DR Power Equipment. “We have watched the Mean Green team grow and develop
new products and technologies, which led us to proactively pursue them to become part of our
portfolio. Mean Green products will supplement our expanding battery-powered, chore products line up
and support our goals to integrate and develop new battery-powered solutions.”

“We are extremely excited for the opportunity to further expand on our vision to provide consumers
with meaningful battery powered equipment,” said Joe Conrad, President and Owner of Mean Green
Products. “The DR Power and Generac teams are an excellent fit for our company and our employees.”

<h3>Forward-looking Information</h3>

<p>Certain statements contained in this news release, as well as other information provided from time to
time by Generac Holdings Inc. or its employees, may contain forward looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward
looking statements. Forward-looking statements give Generac's current expectations and projections
relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future
performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not
relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "plan," "intend," "believe," "confident," "may," "should,"
"can have," "likely," "future," “optimistic” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection
with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.</p>

<p>Any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks,
uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although Generac
believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware
that many factors could affect Generac's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from
those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:30px">
<li>frequency and duration of power outages impacting demand for our products;</li>

<li>availability, cost and quality of raw materials and key components from our global supply chain and labor needed in producing our products;</li>

<li>the impact on our results of possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities, product mix and regulatory tariffs;</li>

<li>the possibility that the expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings of our acquisitions will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period;</li>

<li>the risk that our acquisitions will not be integrated successfully;</li>

<li>difficulties we may encounter as our business expands globally or into new markets;</li>

<li>our dependence on our distribution network;</li>

<li>our ability to invest in, develop or adapt to changing technologies and manufacturing techniques;</li>

<li>loss of our key management and employees;</li>

<li>increase in product and other liability claims or recalls;</li>

<li>failures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems;</li>

<li>changes in environmental, health and safety, or product compliance laws and regulations affecting our products or operations; and</li>

<li>the duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may or will continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for certain of our products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Generac's actual results may vary in
material respects from those projected in any forward-looking statements. In the current environment,
some of the above factors have materialized and may or will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, which may cause actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. A detailed
discussion of these and other factors that may affect future results is contained in Generac's filings with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), particularly in the Risk Factors section of the 2019
Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Stockholders, potential investors
and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.</p>
