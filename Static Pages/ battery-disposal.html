<h3 class="static-page-title">Product Support</h3>  <h1>Battery Disposal</h1> <p>There are many different types of batteries, and most of them have federal and state regulations relating to their disposal. Most types of batteries contain heavy metals that, when thrown out in the trash, leak into landfills and cause serious environmental damage. When incinerated, as some waste is, they release toxic chemicals into the air that is very harmful to public health. Before disposing of your old batteries, learn about the pertinent disposal requirements or <a href="http://www.call2recycle.org/locator/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here to find a battery drop-off location near you</a>.</p>  <h2>DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Equipment and Neuton<sup>&reg;</sup> Batteries</h2> <p>DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machines use rechargeable lead-acid batteries for their electric-starting mechanisms. Neuton<sup>&reg;</sup> Battery-Electric Lawn Mowers use rechargeable lead-acid batteries for their power as well. If you are discarding your machine's battery (i.e. if you have purchased a replacement battery), be sure to understand the safety and legal requirements regarding their disposal. In the US, it is illegal to simply discard these batteries in the trash (see the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rcra/mercury-containing-and-rechargeable-battery-management-act-public-law-104-142" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Act</a> of 1996). Each state has its own regulations regarding lead-acid battery disposal as well. <a href="http://www.call2recycle.org/locator/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click here to find a battery drop-off location near you</a>.</p>   <h2>DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Cordless Yard Tools Batteries</h2> <p>DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Cordless Yard Tools use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Because these are less hazardous than lead-acid batteries, their disposal in small numbers is not regulated by federal agencies. However, there are still heavy metals present in lithium-ion batteries and they should be recycled if possible. Some state agencies regulate the disposal of lithium-ion batteries. <a href="http://www.call2recycle.org/recycling-laws-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See your state's regulations here</a>.</p> <p>Many businesses and waste management companies will accept lithium-ion batteries for recycling. Find one near you here. You can also bring them to a DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Factory Store for recycling.</p>  <h2>Neuton<sup>&reg;</sup> Cordless Yard Tools Batteries</h2> <p>The (now unavailable) Neuton<sup>&reg;</sup> Cordless Yard Tools used rechargeable Ni-Cd (nickel-cadmium) batteries. Like lithium-ion batteries, their disposal is not regulated by federal agencies, but may be regulated by state agencies. <a href="http://www.call2recycle.org/recycling-laws-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See your state's regulations here</a>.</p> <p>Many businesses and waste management companies will accept Ni-Cd batteries for recycling. <a href="http://search.earth911.com/?utm_source=earth911-headerfooter&amp;utm_medium=secondary-nav&amp;utm_campaign=advanced-search" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Find one near you here</a>.
