  <h2>For Purchases of $799 or more</h2>
  <h4>0% Interest for 36 Months*</h4>
  <p>On purchases of $799 or more with your DR Power (a Generac company) Synchrony credit card. Equal Monthly Payments
    Required for 36 months. Promo fee of 2% of amount financed will be included in required monthly payments. </p>
  <div class="notice">
    <p> <i>*Offer applies only to single-receipt qualifying purchases. A promo fee, equal to 2% of the amount financed
        at time of purchase, will be shown as a separate transaction on your billing statement and included in the
        balance subject to this promo. Any taxes, delivery or other charges included in the amount financed will
        increase the related promo fee and the required monthly payments. For example, a $950 purchase with $50 in taxes
        and shipping costs, will be charged a promo fee equal to $20 and $1,020 will be charged to your account. This
        purchase qualifies for the following financing promo with a promo fee of 2% of total transaction. If you do not
        want this promo and want to make a different selection, notify the merchant now or, if an online purchase,
        return to cart. No interest will be charged on the amount financed (including related promo fee), and equal
        monthly payments are required on such balance until it is paid in full. The payments equal the amount financed
        (including related promo fee) divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded up to the next cent.
        These payments may be higher than the payments that would be required if this purchase was a non-promo purchase.
        During the last month(s) of the promo period the required monthly payment may be reduced due to the prior months
        rounding. For new accounts, as of April 11, 2025, Purchase APR is 34.99%; Penalty APR is 39.99%; Minimum Interest
        Charge is $2. Existing cardholder should see their credit card agreement for their applicable terms. Subject to
        credit approval. </i> </p>
