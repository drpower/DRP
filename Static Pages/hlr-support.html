With big, power-driven wheels and low climbing gears, this hauler can easily climb slopes of up to 15&deg;. Plus, with the weight of the load positioned over the drive wheels, the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon has the traction to climb slopes where riding tractors and trailers would quickly slip and slide. The truth is, many owners have told us the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon has enabled them to do work on their sloping properties that they just couldn't do before.</p>   <h3>Q: Can I use my DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon on soft or uneven ground?</h3>   <p>A: Yes! With its high clearance, wide track, and high-flotation tires, the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon is very well-suited to rough terrain. Many owners find it perfect for use in overgrown meadows, fields, woodlots, or &quot;off-lawn&quot; areas where riding tractors and trailers would get hung up on ruts, downed tree limbs, rocks, and stumps. Commercial users have also told us the machine is great for hauling building materials like lumber, plywood, bricks, cinder blocks, etc., around the worksite, where the terrain is simply too rough for a wheelbarrow.</p>   <h3>Q: How difficult is it to steer?</h3>   <p>A: Just like your car, the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon has differential steering. This allows the     drive wheels to rotate at different speeds, making the     DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon exceptionally easy to turn. And with dual     rear-mounted caster wheels that rotates 360 degrees, the     machine quickly and easily maneuvers in the tightest     spots, even under the heaviest load.</p>   <h3>Q: How easy is it to start?</h3>   <p>A: The electric-starting models with     automotive-style turn-key ignition and 12-volt battery     are very easy to start. Just turn the key and you're     ready to go! (The battery recharges as the engine     runs.) The manual-starting model, with compression     release and electronic ignition, starts with one or two     easy pulls.</p>   <h3>Q: Is it difficult to unload materials     from the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon?</h3>   <p>A: Not at all. The entire bed of the     DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon can easily be tipped by releasing the     dump bed lever. You can position and dump loads of     gravel, sand, topsoil, manure, compost, firewood, etc.,     right where you want them, much like a dump truck. This     feature practically eliminates tiresome shoveling when     unloading by hand. You can even spread loose loads like     gravel by tipping the bed and backing up     slowly...saving a lot of hand grading and raking. For     even easier unloading, see the Powered Lift option.</p>   <h3>Q: How fast will the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon travel?</h3>   <p>A: In top gear and at full throttle, each model has a maximum speed of 3.7 mph.</p>   <h3>Q: How are DR<sup>&reg;</sup> products shipped?</h3>   <p>A: We offer 3 basic options:<br />     1) Delivery to a Depot<br />     2) Delivery to Home or Business<br />     3) Enhanced Home Delivery</p>   <h3>Q: What happens if my machine needs service?</h3>   <p>A: Our knowledgeable representatives have an extensive understanding of DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Haulers and will be able to identify the problem and the best solution. If necessary, we can have replacement parts shipped to you right away, or direct you to one of our authorized DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Service Centers nationwide.</p>   <h3>Q: How does your 6 Month Hands-On Trial work?</h3>   <p>A: We are so confident you'll love your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machine that we want you to be able to try it out on your own property virtually risk-free. If at any time during the first 6 months of owning your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> (6 months from the date it ships) you decide that it isn't right for you, or wish to exchange it for a different model, we will take it back, no questions asked, for a full refund, less shipping to and from your delivery location. <a href="/pages/content/customer-support/shopping-resources/trial">See more information here.</a></p>   <h3>Q: How does my warranty work?</h3>   <p>A: DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machines come with a 2-year warranty (for residential use, 90 days for commercial use) that covers all defects in materials and workmanship.

This will help to eliminate       sludge and acids in the engine. For winter use, use SAE       5W-30W oil.</li>     <li>Remove the spark plug(s) and pour about 1 ounce of       motor oil into the cylinder hole. Replace the plug and pull       the recoil starter rope (if equipped) or crank the engine       over using the electric start. This will coat the piston       and seat the valves to prevent moisture buildup.</li>     <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Powerwagon will be idle for more than 30       days, we recommend using <a href="/power-equipment/batteries-parts-and-maintenance/machine-maintenance/maintenance/dr-ethanol-fuel-treatment-24-oz.axd"> DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Ethanol Fuel Treatment</a>. This will prevent fuel from decomposing and gumming up the carburetor. If there is sediment or moisture       in the gas or tank, remove it by draining the tank.       Completely fill the tank with fresh, unleaded gas and       add the appropriate amount of fuel treatment.
