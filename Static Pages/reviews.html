The package and pallet arrived in good condition and timely as promised. The machine looks like it will be a strong performer, no snow now in N.

            <div class="comments">&ldquo;the shopping experience was great, however the delivery of the product (the trailer) was and continues to be a nightmare. Had I known how much trouble I would have and how many days I have lost due to the inability to deliver of the trailer I would not do it again.<br />
              I was called on 6/3 to schedule delivery 6/6. They didn't deliver and didn't call. Then I got an email that they couldn't locate my freight.  I called the 6/7 to work out another delivery, 6/11.  I had afternoon appointments so requested delivery before 2.  They said no problem. it didn't show up by 2.  I got on line and checked and without telling me the set delivery noon - 6pm.  the driver showed up at 6 however even though I paid for tail gate delivery to the ground, and they knew it, it was on the form, they sent it out in a truck without lift.  They could not unload the 767 lb trailer.<br />
              We are now set for 6/13 2 - 6 pm. ?? we shall see how it goes.<br />
              <br />
              They also said they have to unload at the highway because we have a dirt driveway (although it is well maintained).  we have had several trucks of this size deliver to our door. American Furniture delivered in 8 inches of snow with no problems. ???<br />
              <br />
              I think you should check up on who is making deliveries for you.&rdquo;</div>

As I have gotten older I hate lugging the hand held line trimmers, gas ot battery around.  I have too much area to cover as I prepare to grass seed sometime soon.  I have strong expectation this one will do just fine for 40 minutes before I have to go inside and grab a cold iced tea.  Hope all goes smooth around my property in just a few more days awaiting it's arrival.&rdquo;</div>
