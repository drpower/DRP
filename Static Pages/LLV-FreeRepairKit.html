    <h1>Leaf and Lawn Vacuum Repair Kit Request</h1><hr>
   
<p>The reason for the recall is the risk that pieces from the leaf vacuums can come loose inside the unit, or debris can pierce the chute, resulting in material ejecting and posing a laceration hazard.</p>
<p>DR Power is offering consumers a free consumer-installed remedy kit. The repair kit should be installed even on units that were previously repaired by a dealer as part of the recall previously announced Iast year.
</p>
<p>This recall involves the DR Power brand tow-behind or walk-behind leaf vacuums. For tow-behind leaf vacuums, the model number is printed on the data tag located on the impeller housing beside the engine. For walk-behind leaf vacuums, the model number is printed on the front right side of the unit behind the wheel.</p>

<p>Please check your leaf vacuum to verify that it is a recalled unit. If it is a recalled unit, please stop using the leaf vacuum and install a free repair kit. It is important to install this repair kit, even if you already had a dealer-installed repair.
</p>
<p>If you still own one of the affected leaf vacuums, you may rquest the free repair kit below, which can be easily installed on your leaf vacuum,</p>
