<div class="static-content-container fleft"><h3 class="static-page-title">Customer Support</h3> <h1>Scheduling a Warranty Repair</h1> <p>Whether your machine needs service or just a seasonal tune up, we have a large network of authorized warranty service centers around the country to help you. Before you search for a local service center though, we recommend you be aware of the following:</p> <ul>   <li>Most service centers (not just the ones found on our locator) have a lead time for service, especially during seasonal peaks. We highly recommend calling before you visit to inquire about lead time, store hours, if they work on the particular machine you need repaired (IE: some shops on our locator do not work on hydraulics), and any other questions you may have about the visit.</li> </ul> <ul>   <li>If your engine needs repair and you are covered under your engine manufacturer warranty, you will want to be sure to find a service center authorized to do warranty work for that engine manufacturer. We recommend checking the engine manufacturer website for shops authorized to do warranty work for them.     <p><br />       Engine manufacturer locators:</p><ul>       <li><a href="http://www.briggsandstratton.com/us/en/support/dealerlocator" target="_blank">Briggs and Stratton</a></li>       <li><a href="http://engines.honda.com/dealer-locator/" target="_blank">Honda</a></li>       <li><a href="http://www.kawasaki.com/DealerLocatorPower/Search" target="_blank">Kawasaki</a></li>       <li><a href="http://kohlerengines.com/wheretobuy/landing.htm#results" target="_blank">Kohler</a></li>       <li><a href="http://www.subarupower.com/dealer-locator/" target="_blank">Subaru</a></li>     </ul>     <p>&nbsp;</p></li> </ul> <ul>   <li>If your DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machine is under warranty, we recommend reading the warranty slip that you received with your machine so you are aware of what is and is not covered under warranty. If you do not have this document, visit our <a href="/pages/content/customer-support/shopping-resources/warranty">Warranty Information</a> page and select your machine to view a copy of the warranty information for it.</li> </ul> <ul>   <li>If you are unsure whether or not your machine is still within its warranty coverage period, just ask our <a href="/pages/content/customer-support/contact">customer service team. </a></li> </ul> <ul>   <li>We do not require that all DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machine repairs during the machine warranty period be performed by authorized warranty service centers. If you are mechanically inclined and would prefer to perform the repair yourself, you can call our technical support department for parts and troubleshooting assistance. (Note: This does not apply to engine repairs during the engine manufacturer warranty period. All DR<sup>&reg;</sup> machine warranty repairs performed by a service center must be performed by a DR<sup>&reg;</sup> authorized warranty repair center for billing purposes.)</li> </ul> <h2>Find a Service Center Near You</h2> <p>To find a warranty authorized service center in your area, visit our <a href="/shop.axd/SalesAndServiceLocator?type=service">Service Center Locator</a>.</p></div>
