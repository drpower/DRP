        <h2 class="media-heading">Where we started</h2>

        <p>It's impossible to say much about the history of DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power
        Equipment without mentioning our late co-founder, Lyman P.
        Wood.</p>

        <p>In the 1960's, Lyman Wood changed the future of American
        gardening by founding the company that later became known as Garden
        Way and developed its first product, the Troy-Bilt<sup>&reg;</sup> Rototiller.
        Over the next two decades Lyman made Troy-Bilt the number one
        selling rototiller in the U.S.</p>

        <p>A few of us here at DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Equipment worked alongside Lyman
        in the 1960's, '70s, and early '80s, helping to sell rototillers
        and the gardening-centered lifestyle they helped make possible. But
        things changed, many Americans turned away from large gardens and
        we - Lyman included - left the tiller business to start a new
        venture. This time the focus was on helping folks care for their
        land and property (in much the same way as we had encouraged them
        to care for their gardens some years before).</p>

        <h2 class="media-heading">Products we sell</h2>

        <p>We grew up with the belief that if you're going to do a job, do
        it right. That's why we think of DR<sup>&reg;</sup> as power equipment that's DONE
        RIGHT&trade;.</p>

        <p>This idea originated over 25 years ago with our first product, the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Trimmer Mower. Back then, our objective was to improve
        upon the hand-held string trimmer. But rather than focus on
        incremental advancements, we chose to radically improve the status
        quo. And that's how we operate today.</p>

        <p>With a talented team of engineers and designers, we're creating
        unique machines of lasting value and unequaled performance. We
        continue to be driven by innovation, with a passion for
        high-quality design. And like you, we have no use for ordinary
        products...so we're doing what it takes to be better.</p>

        <h2 class="media-heading">Our Standards</h2>

        <p>Meet Don Selby, our Product Testing Manager. Don and his team put every new product design through its paces before we offer it for sale. From testing prototypes to adding and tweaking features, they have to give every product design a green light before we start building them for customers like you. For example:</p>

        <p>Before our all-new DR<sup>&reg;</sup> Leaf and Lawn Vacuum line came out, Don and his team tested prototypes for over 400 hours, ensuring they lived up to the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> standard in any working conditions. They even hauled them all the way from Vermont to Montgomery, Alabama to test them in the off-season.</p>

        <p>The team has also split over 700 cords of wood with the DR<sup>&reg;</sup> RapidFire Log Splitter. Along the way, they've added features and modified others to make them even more user-friendly.</p>

        <p>These are the lengths we go to make sure every product we sell effectively does what it should, over and over again, without fail.</p>

        <p>Walk the hallways of our buildings and you'll know right away
          that we have a unique and special place here. From the person who
          answers the phone and takes an order to the team of craftsmen
          building each machine we sell, we are a company of hard working
          and conscientious individuals.</p>
        <p>Driven by a shared commitment to quality - in everything we do -

        provide to our customers, and each other.</p>

        <p>That's how we've created such a sought-after work environment -
        one that continually attracts the very best people. The kind of
        people who care about the company they work for, the job they do
        and the customers they serve. If you are interested in joining our

        <h2 class="media-heading">Our Vermont roots</h2>

        <p>We are a growing, friendly company located in South Burlington,
        Vermont. We make our home here for many reasons, but mainly we want
        to surround ourselves with what we love - a place of rural beauty
        with simple and traditional values.</p>

        <p>It's here that we pursue our love of the land and are inspired
        with some of our best new product ideas. As our customer, we think
        it's something you can take comfort in - knowing the products we
        sell are born out of the experiences we face caring for and
        maintaining our own country properties. That's why they work.
        Because we wouldn't use them ourselves - or sell them - if they
        didn't.</p>
