            <strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong> <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This Cookie Notice explains how Generac Power Systems, Inc. and/or its
            affiliated entities (“<strong>Generac</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”,
            “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) use cookies and similar
            technologies when you visit our websites, including Generac.com and
            https://www.generac.com/, pages, features or content we own or operate (the
            "<strong>Websites</strong>"), when you use the Generac or Generac Workplace
            mobile apps and/or when you interact with Generac online advertisements
            (collectively the "<strong>Services</strong>"). This Cookie Notice also
            explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your
            rights to control our use of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect
            personal data, or information that becomes personal data if we combine it
            with other information. In such cases, Generac’s

                Global Privacy Notice

            <strong>2. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</strong> <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies are small data files that a website sends to your web browser to
            store on your computer, mobile phone or other device in order to remember
            information about you. When you return to these websites using the same
            device and web browser, or visit other websites that use the same cookies,
            the websites are able to recognize your device and preferences. By
            themselves, cookies do not identify you specifically. Rather, they recognize
            your browser or device. Cookies can retrieve only the information that they
            have stored on your device; they cannot access any other information about
            you from your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies that are set by the website operator are called first-party cookies.
            These cookies allow website operators to collect analytics data, remember
            language settings and perform other useful functions that generally improve
            your user experience. Cookies that are set by parties other than the website
            operator are called third-party cookies. These cookies are usually used for
            online advertising purposes and placed on a website through a script or tag
            so that you see content more relevant to you and your interests. Third-party
            cookies are accessible on any website that loads the third-party server’s
            code.

                            partners to display advertising on the Websites and Services
                            and to display advertising on third-party websites that may
                            be relevant to you and your interests. These cookies are

                            advertising campaigns. They remember that you have visited a
                            website and this information may be shared with other
                            organizations such as advertising partners. This means that
                            after you have been to any of the Websites, you may see some
                            advertisements about the Services elsewhere on the Internet.

            <strong>4. WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?</strong> <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As is common practice among companies that operate online, we use common
            information-gathering technologies such as cookies, web beacons and other
            similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information as you
            access the Websites and Services. We use these technologies to better
            understand how you navigate and interact with the Websites and Services and
            to make your experience more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use first-party and third-party cookies to recognize you as a Generac
            customer, to enable your use and access of the Websites and Services, to
            customize and improve the Websites and Services (e.g., to remember your
            username, language or other preferences), to optimize and measure the
            effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, to better understand your use of
            the Websites and to collect information about your computer or other device
            to help prevent fraud and promote the safety and security of the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also use cookies on the Websites and Services that enable third-party
            service providers (e.g., social media companies and advertising partners) to
            assist us in displaying ads specific to your interests across the internet
            (also referred to as “online behavioral/targeted advertising” or
            “interest-based advertising”). We do not control the types of information
            collected and stored by these third-party cookies. You should refer to the
            third-party's website for more information on how they use cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information we collect from cookies includes:
        </p>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                Aggregated information that does not identify you directly, which
                includes statistical information about how you use the Websites and
                Services or information that is linked to a cookie ID or other
                identification that is not paired in our records with your identifiable
                information; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Information about you, your computer or device, collected automatically
                using cookies and common tracking technologies (as further described in
                Section 6 (<em>What Other Similar Technologies Do We Use?</em>) below)
                when you visit the Websites and Services, including your browser type
                and operating system, and information regarding the content you view and
                features you access on the Websites and Services.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>5. HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY DEVICE?</strong>
            <strong>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on
            whether it is a "session" or a "persistent" cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session cookies are temporary and only stay on your browsing device until
            you close your browser. Persistent cookies stay on your hard drive,
            persisting from session to session until you delete them or they reach a set
            expiration date. Persistent cookies are sometimes called tracking cookies
            because they are used to collect user information such as browsing habits
            and preferences over a longer period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. WHAT OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE?</strong>
            <strong>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies to track users
            of the Websites and Services. These technologies may include:
        </p>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                <strong>Pixel Tags and Trackers.</strong>Web beacons (or “clear gifs”),
                pixel tags and tracking urls are tiny graphic images and/or small blocks
                of code with a unique identifier placed on a website or advertisement
                and function in a similar way to cookies. These technologies allow us to
                track your online movements when you interact with the Websites and
                Services. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer or
                other device, these technologies are embedded invisibly on web pages. We
                and our third-party service providers employ web beacons for the
                purposes stated above in Section 4 (<em>Why Do We Use Cookies?</em>),
                but primarily to help us better manage content on the Websites and
                Services by informing us which content is effective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                <strong>Google Analytics.</strong>We use Google Analytics, which uses
                cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information
                about your use of the Services and report on activities and trends.
                This service may also collect information regarding the use of other
                websites, applications and online resources. You can learn more about
                Google Analytics by visiting this

                .
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These other technologies function in a similar way to cookies. Accordingly,
            when we use the word 'cookies' in this Cookie Notice, we refer to cookies
            and all other similar technologies.

            Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based
            advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the
            Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where
            individuals can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To
            opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each
            organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s

                website
            </a>
            . Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioral
            advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising

            they will not be tailored to your interests.

            <strong>7.2 Personalized Mobile Advertising</strong> <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for
            certain types of advertising by accessing the appropriate settings on your
            mobile device and following the instructions. If you opt-out, we will remove
            all data about you and will not collect any further data. The random ID
            previously assigned to you will be removed.  If at a later date, you decide
            to opt-in, we will be unable to track you using your prior ID and you will
            for all intents and purposes be a new user. To control interest-based
            tracking on iOS devices, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt;
            Apple Advertising &gt; toggle “Personalized Ads” on or off. For Android
            devices, go to Settings &gt; Google services &gt; Ads &gt;  toggle “Opt out
            of Ads Personalization" on or off. For iOS and Android devices, you can also
            reset the advertising identifier that is currently assigned to you.
