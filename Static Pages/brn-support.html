Without the <a href="/shop.axd/Search?keywords=Ash+Catcher">Ash Catcher</a>, the ashes will be left on the ground.</p>   <h3>Q: How do you get the ashes out when it is full?</h3>   <p>A: To empty the BurnCage, you simply lift it up and set it off to the side and dispose of the ashes. Be sure that the ashes are cold and no longer burning. We recommend that you water the ashes down.</p>   <h3>Q: How do you install the optional ash catcher?</h3>   <p>A: The BurnCage simply sits on the Ash Catcher, helps prevent damage to concrete slabs, tree roots, etc.</p>   <h3>Q: What is the average lifetime of this item?</h3>   <p>A: The BurnCage is constructed of rugged 16 gauge &quot;439&quot; Stainless Steel. It will handle temperatures up to 1600 degrees F, allowing for many years of use.</p>   <h3>Q: What specific stainless is this made from and gauge of material?</h3>   <p>A: The BurnCage is made of 439 stainless steel. It Is a terrific stainless steel that is best suited for use in oxidizing environments, where excellent corrosion resistance is required. Type &quot;439&quot; also has superior formality capabilities and is heavily used in the automobile industry. It is often used in place of &quot;409&quot; where higher thermal conductivity is required like mufflers and furnaces.</p>   <h3>Q: Are the panels individually replaceable?</h3>   <p>A: The panels are not separate or replaceable.</p>   <h3>Q: Can it be used to burn kitchen garbage?</h3>   <p>A: Each state has their own burn laws. You will need to contact your local officials to see what the rules and regulations are for burning trash in your area.</p>   <h3>Q: Is the BurnCage effective for pine needles?</h3>   <p>A: The BurnCage is a safe and efficient way to burn certain debris, but pine needles need to be on the dry side to ensure it flames quickly and efficiently. They should never be allowed to smolder or generate excessive smoke. You will want to contact your local authorities to check if burning pine needles is permitted. Most cities and towns have a pre-approved burn list to avoid buring prohibitive debris.</p></div> <div id="safety" class="border-bottom border-gray"><h1>Safety Information</h1>   <h3>Important safety information regarding your BurnCage</h3>   <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="ss-icon">warning</i> <strong>Warning:</strong>     <p>Read this safety &amp; operating Instructions manual before you use the BurnCage.
